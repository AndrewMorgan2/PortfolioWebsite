# My Portfolio Website 
To run this locally you can use "npm install" to install dependencies then "npm start" to start a local version on https://localhost:3000
## Modules 
The only modules of any interest are in src/components.
There are a few that aren't visable on the website because they weren't written by me (stockfish and registerServiceWorker), they exist because I was messing with service workers and how they work in react (the framework used for this website)
